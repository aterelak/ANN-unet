# Artificial Neural Network
## _Final Project_
### Introduction
Here is a repository of the final project for the [Artificial Neural Network class](https://usosweb.umk.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=2401-CS-21-ANN-s2), being part of the [MSc in Cognitive Science](https://kognitywistyka.umk.pl/pages/cognitive_science/) programme in Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

The objective of our code is to explore the U-Net model architecture, a popular segmentation model architecture introduced in the paper "[U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)" (Ronneberger et al., 2015). The exploration of this model architecture is conducted via brain tumour segmentation. Our code is provided in a notebook, where we used, i.e. the advantages of PyTorch.

The authors of the project are: [Alicja Terelak](https://github.com/aterelak), [Hiba Asif](https://github.com/A-Hiba), [Hasibe Savaş](https://github.com/hasibesavas), and Kinga Mazurek.
